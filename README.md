# System Design

### 1. Source of instability
- Integration points (Endpoints)
- Slow processes
- Unreliable network
- Unexpected load
- Cascading failures

### 2. Networks
- Latency and throughput
- DNS
- TCP
- TLS
- HTTP
- Proxies and Load balancing
- CDN
- Polling and streaming

### 3. Consistency 
- Consistency Models
- Failure detection
- Leader election
- Consensus - two phase commit
- Consensus - Raft
- Ordering

### 4. Design Patterns

### 5. Storage
- Relational
- Document
- Columnar
- Graph
- Key-Value

### 6. Stability Patterns
- Timeouts
- Retry
- Circuit breakers
- Load shedding
- Rate limiting
- Health endpoint

### 7. Operations
- Metrics
- Logs
- alerts
- Watchdog
- Chaos tests
- SLOs

### 8. Design Process
- Requirmements
- Estimation
- Interfaces
- System desing
- Risk reduction
- Bottleneck Optimization
